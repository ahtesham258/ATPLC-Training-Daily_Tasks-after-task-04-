<li> 2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal </li>

</ul> 
When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions,
 they received more than 19 million (1.9 crores) job applications.<br>

 hired by the government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs.
